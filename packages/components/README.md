# The Serge Component library

This package contains all of the custom-made components for the Serge project. To see a list of all components used in the project and examples of each one (including the non-custom Material Design components). Please run the storybook package.

## How to run storybook

In the root of the serge project, ensure that you have installed all packages and dependencies and then run the project:

```bash
yarn install
yarn storybook
```

## Material Design

We only build out custom components when we need to, for the most part, our components come from the Material-UI library, you can find more information about that on the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) Website

## Contributing

If you want to contribute components to the library, please review our [Development Standards Guidelines](../../development-standards.md) first.
